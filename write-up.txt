I'll keep it quick:

__INCOMPLETE~ISH__
- There is no checking if the words are correct
- There is no button to shuffle or get more tiles, you get 7 and must refresh to get a new hand
- You cannot submit words and get more letters

__COMPLETE__
- You can place and remove letters and the word/score will be updated dynamically
- Each refresh gives you a new hand from a generated 'bag' that has each tile in it
- the the pretty pictures are there
- the score will double properly
- UI will inform the player if a word has spaces in it

__BUGS__
- There is an unfortunate bug from the jQuery UI where it may count an item being dropped or
	moved over a tile twice. I worked around this as much as I could, but it still results in 
	some letters being counted twice.
- Another thing I couldn't work around is when a tile is dragged inside of a slot, it will
	continue to count up the score indefinitely
