I'll keep it quick:

__INCOMPLETE~ISH__
- There is no checking if the words are correct
- Words on the board will be deleted and counted towards your score 
	regardless of correctness

__COMPLETE__
- Once a word is submitted it is counted and the tiles are removed and 
	replaced in your hand.
- A game over will alert the player when no more tiles are on the board
- You can place and remove letters and the word/score will be updated dynamically
- Each refresh gives you a new hand from a generated 'bag' that has each tile in it
- the the pretty pictures are there
- the score will double properly
- UI will inform the player if a word has spaces in it

__BUGS__
- There is an unfortunate bug from the jQuery UI where it may count an item being dropped or
	moved over a tile twice. I worked around this as much as I could, but it still results in 
	some letters being counted twice.
- Another thing I couldn't work around is when a tile is dragged inside of a slot, it will
	continue to count up the score indefinitely
